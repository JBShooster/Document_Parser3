Document_Parser3
================

The third and final segment of document parser (works w Project Gutenberg)

Here I utilize raw_input() to extract keywords from the user which then gets put into sys.argv. From there, I use functions
to simplify the processes of the previous two parsers. The output is the metadata of several texts derived from Project
Gutenberg. It includes the Title, Author, Illustrator and Translator. After that, it displays how much of each word is in
the texts selected.
